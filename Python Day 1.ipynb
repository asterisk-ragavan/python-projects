    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed."

    "## Python Version\n",
    "### Python 2\n",
    "Published in late 2000, Python 2 signalled a more transparent and inclusive language development process than earlier versions of Python with the implementation of PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), a technical specification that either provides information to Python community members or describes a new feature of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python 2 included many more programmatic features including a cycle-detecting garbage collector to automate memory management, increased Unicode support to standardize characters, and list comprehensions to create a list based on existing lists. As Python 2 continued to develop, more features were added, including unifying Python’s types and classes into one hierarchy in Python version 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 is regarded as the future of Python and is the version of the language that is currently in development. A major overhaul, Python 3 was released in late 2008 to address and amend intrinsic design flaws of previous versions of the language. The focus of Python 3 development was to clean up the codebase and remove redundancy, making it clear that there was only one way to perform a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major modifications to Python 3.0 included changing the print statement into a built-in function, improve the way integers are divided, and providing more Unicode support.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, Python 3 was slowly adopted due to the language not being backwards compatible with Python 2, requiring people to make a decision as to which version of the language to use. Additionally, many package libraries were only available for Python 2, but as the development team behind Python 3 has reiterated that there is an end of life for Python 2 support, more libraries have been ported to Python 3. The increased adoption of Python 3 can be shown by the number of Python packages that now provide Python 3 support, which at the time of writing includes 339 of the 360 most popular Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the 2008 release of Python 3.0, Python 2.7 was published on July 3, 2010 and planned as the last of the 2.x releases. The intention behind Python 2.7 was to make it easier for Python 2.x users to port features over to Python 3 by providing some measure of compatibility between the two. This compatibility support included enhanced modules for version 2.7 like unittest to support test automation, argparse for parsing command-line options, and more convenient classes in collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of Python 2.7’s unique position as a version in between the earlier iterations of Python 2 and Python 3.0, it has persisted as a very popular choice for programmers due to its compatibility with many robust libraries. When we talk about Python 2 today, we are typically referring to the Python 2.7 release as that is the most frequently used version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7, however, is considered to be a legacy language and its continued development, which today mostly consists of bug fixes, will cease completely in 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "While Python 2.7 and Python 3 share many similar capabilities, they should not be thought of as entirely interchangeable. Though you can write good code and useful programs in either version, it is worth understanding that there will be some considerable differences in code syntax and handling.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks grew out of the IPython project started by Fernando Perez. IPython is an interactive shell, similar to the normal Python shell but with great features like syntax highlighting and code completion. Originally, notebooks worked by sending messages from the web app (the notebook you see in the browser) to an IPython kernel (an IPython application running in the background). The kernel executed the code, then sent it back to the notebook. The current architecture is similar, drawn out below.\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/notebook-components.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The central point is the notebook server. You connect to the server through your browser and the notebook is rendered as a web app. Code you write in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel. The kernel runs the code and sends it back to the server, then any output is rendered back in the browser. When you save the notebook, it is written to the server as a JSON file with a .ipynb file extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great part of this architecture is that the kernel doesn't need to run Python. Since the notebook and the kernel are separate, code in any language can be sent between them. For example, two of the earlier non-Python kernels were for the R and Julia languages. With an R kernel, code written in R will be sent to the R kernel where it is executed, exactly the same as Python code running on a Python kernel. IPython notebooks were renamed because notebooks became language agnostic. The new name Jupyter comes from the combination of Julia, Python, and R. If you're interested, here's a list of available kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit is that the server can be run anywhere and accessed via the internet. Typically you'll be running the server on your own machine where all your data and notebook files are stored. But, you could also set up a server on a remote machine or cloud instance like Amazon's EC2. Then, you can access the notebooks in your browser from anywhere in the world.\n",
